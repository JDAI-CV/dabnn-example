This example contains Bi-Real Net 18 with Stem Module (The network structure will be described in detail in our coming paper). 

Just try it in Android Studio :)

Note: This demo uses OpenCV to read camera, however, the app orientation can only be landscape due to [a bug of OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/4704). PRs which replace OpenCV by raw Android Camera API are welcomed.
